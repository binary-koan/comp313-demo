Started with Roll a Ball tutorial

Used CharacterController for the player - considered RigidBody but wanted
good directional movement support and ability to walk up steps etc

Tried using CharacterController for the NPC as well but the movement script
became quite complex; it made more sense in the end to use NavMeshAgent,
which has built in path following

Various problems with conflicting scripts - for example, turning Pickups into
physics objects but forgetting to turn off the Rotator script meant that they
slid strangely around the scene trying to rotate

Inconsistencies between components also became a problem - for example the fact
that a CharacterController collides using OnControllerColliderHit, not
OnCollisionEnter.

Another challenge was 3D positioning, movement and rotation - since I haven't done
much 3D graphics I struggled to understand what many of the Vector and Quaternion
operations were doing. It doesn't help that many components (CharacterController,
RigidBody, NavMeshAgent) have their own methods to move the object.

Decision: Originally the NPC used asynchronous events instead of a state machine
to do things like paused states, but I decided that having an explicit State.PAUSED
makes things more explicit and easier to work with despite the annoyance of incrementing
and comparing pausedTime manually.
